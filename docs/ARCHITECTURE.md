## Introduction ##
This project involves developing a news website with features for authentication and authorization. Users can view public posts, while admins can manage posts, moderators, and approve posts. Moderators can add or edit posts but cannot modify approved posts. The project uses React for the frontend, Node.js with an ORM for the backend, and supports the database. The News Website Project is designed to provide a platform where users can view and interact with news content, while administrators and moderators manage the content and user roles. The architecture of the application is built with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability, ensuring that it can handle a growing user base and evolving feature set. 

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the application, describing the key components, their interactions, and the flow of data within the system. It also addresses the security considerations for authentication and authorization, which are critical to protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of the content management process. <br>

The project utilizes modern web development technologies, including React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and a choice of relational or NoSQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) for data storage. The use of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer ensures smooth interaction between the application and the database, promoting code maintainability and reducing the risk of SQL injection attacks.<br>

This document serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders to understand the technical foundation of the application, the rationale behind the chosen technologies, and how different components work together to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Project Structure ##
Here’s an overview of the project structure: 

1. High-Level System Architecture Diagram
Diagram Overview:

Frontend (React): The user interface where users interact with the application.
Backend (Node.js/Express): The server-side logic that handles API requests, processes data, and communicates with the database.
Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB): Stores user information, posts, and other relevant data.
Authentication & Authorization (JWT): Manages secure access to the application’s resources based on user roles.
Swagger: Provides API documentation for developers.
