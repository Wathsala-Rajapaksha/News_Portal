## Introduction ##
This project involves developing a news website with features for authentication and authorization. Users can view public posts, while admins can manage posts, moderators, and approve posts. Moderators can add or edit posts but cannot modify approved posts. The project uses React for the frontend, Node.js with an ORM for the backend, and supports the database. The News Website Project is designed to provide a platform where users can view and interact with news content, while administrators and moderators manage the content and user roles. The architecture of the application is built with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability, ensuring that it can handle a growing user base and evolving feature set. 

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the application, describing the key components, their interactions, and the flow of data within the system. It also addresses the security considerations for authentication and authorization, which are critical to protecting user data and maintaining the integrity of the content management process. 

The project utilizes modern web development technologies, including React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and a choice of relational or NoSQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) for data storage. The use of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer ensures smooth interaction between the application and the database, promoting code maintainability and reducing the risk of SQL injection attacks.

This document serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders to understand the technical foundation of the application, the rationale behind the chosen technologies, and how different components work together to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Project Structure ##
Here’s an overview of the project structure: 

1. ## High-Level System Architecture Diagram ##
Diagram Overview:

Frontend (React): The user interface where users interact with the application.
Backend (Node.js/Express): The server-side logic that handles API requests, processes data, and communicates with the database.
Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB): Stores user information, posts, and other relevant data.
Authentication & Authorization (JWT): Manages secure access to the application’s resources based on user roles.
Swagger: Provides API documentation for developers.

2. ## Description of Main Components and Their Interactions ##
**Frontend (React)**

Purpose: The frontend serves as the user interface, allowing users to view and interact with news posts, log in, and manage posts (for authorized users).
Components:
Pages: Each page corresponds to a specific view (e.g., Home, Admin Dashboard).
Services: Handle API requests and responses.
State Management: Manages application state, particularly authentication and user roles.

**Backend (Node.js/Express)**
Purpose: The backend processes requests from the frontend, handles business logic, interacts with the database, and returns the appropriate responses.
Components:
Controllers: Manage the logic for different endpoints (e.g., user authentication, post management).
Models: Represent the structure of the database tables/collections.
Routes: Define the API endpoints and map them to the appropriate controllers.
Middleware: Handle tasks such as authentication, error handling, and data validation.

**Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)**
Purpose: Store and retrieve persistent data, including user credentials, roles, and posts.
Components:
Tables/Collections: Store entities such as users and posts.
Queries: Perform CRUD operations based on requests from the backend.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
Purpose: Securely manage user authentication and role-based access control.

Components:
Token Generation: Create tokens upon user login.
Token Verification: Validate tokens for protected routes.

**Swagger**
Purpose: Provide interactive API documentation for developers.

**Components:**
Swagger UI: A user-friendly interface to explore and test the API.
OpenAPI Specification: Define the structure and behavior of API endpoints.

**Interactions:**
User requests data via the frontend.
Frontend sends an API request to the backend.
Backend processes the request, interacts with the database if needed, and sends a response.
Frontend displays the data or updates the UI accordingly.


## Explanation of the Data Flow from Frontend to Backend ##

_User Interaction:
The user interacts with the UI, such as clicking on a post or submitting a form.

_Frontend API Request:

The frontend sends an HTTP request to the backend API (e.g., GET /api/posts to retrieve posts).
If the request requires authentication, the JWT is included in the request header.

_Backend Processing:

The backend receives the request, routes it to the appropriate controller.
The controller processes the request, possibly querying the database or performing other business logic.
The controller generates a response (e.g., JSON data for posts) and sends it back to the frontend.

_Database Interaction:

For data retrieval or storage, the backend queries the database.
The database returns the requested data, which the backend then processes and sends back to the frontend.

_Frontend Response Handling:
The frontend receives the backend's response.
The UI is updated based on the received data (e.g., displaying posts, showing error messages).

_Data Flow Example:

Login:
1.User submits login credentials on the frontend.
2.Frontend sends a POST /api/auth/login request with credentials.
3.Backend authenticates the user and generates a JWT.
4.JWT is sent to the frontend in the response.
5.Frontend stores the JWT (e.g., in localStorage or sessionStorage).
6.Subsequent requests include the JWT in the header to access protected routes.

## Security Considerations for Authentication and Authorization ##

**JWT Token Security:**
Expiration: JWTs are given a limited lifespan to minimize the risk of abuse.
Storage: Tokens are stored in secure, non-persistent storage (e.g., HttpOnly cookies) to prevent XSS attacks.
Encryption: Tokens are signed using a secure algorithm (e.g., HS256) and a strong secret key.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
Admin: Has full access to all resources, including user management and post approval.
Moderator: Limited access, focusing on content creation and moderation.
User: Can view public content but has no privileges to modify or manage content.

**Input Validation & Sanitization:**
Frontend: Validates and sanitizes user inputs before sending to the backend.
Backend: Implements further validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.

**HTTPS:**
Encryption: The entire application should be served over HTTPS to ensure data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted.

**Rate Limiting:**
API Protection: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.

**Error Handling:**
User-Friendly Messages: Avoid exposing sensitive error information to the user.
Logging: Securely log errors for auditing and troubleshooting.

5. ## Justification for Selected Technologies and Libraries ##

**React (Frontend):**
Reason: React is a powerful and flexible library for building user interfaces, with a strong community and extensive resources. It enables the development of dynamic, high-performing web applications with a component-based architecture.

**Node.js with Express (Backend):**
Reason: Node.js is efficient for I/O-bound applications, making it well-suited for handling API requests. Express, as a minimalistic framework, provides the necessary tools to build RESTful APIs, allowing for rapid development with a focus on performance and scalability.

**ORM (Sequelize/TypeORM/Mongoose):**
Reason: Using an ORM simplifies database interaction by allowing developers to work with objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. This improves productivity, ensures consistency across different database systems, and provides built-in features like migrations.

**MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB (Database):**
Reason: These databases are widely used, reliable, and offer strong community support. MySQL and PostgreSQL are excellent for relational data with complex queries, while MongoDB is ideal for applications needing flexible schemas or handling large volumes of unstructured data.

**JWT (Authentication & Authorization):**
Reason: JWT provides a stateless way of handling authentication, reducing the server’s burden and making the system more scalable. It’s secure, easy to implement, and works well with RESTful APIs.

**Swagger (API Documentation):**
Reason: Swagger is the industry standard for API documentation. It allows for automatic generation of interactive, user-friendly documentation directly from the codebase, which helps developers understand and test the API quickly.
